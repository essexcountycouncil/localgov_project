# LocalGov Drupal project for Gitpod

This is a LocalGov Drupal project designed to help you quickly get a demo or playground site up and running quickly, without needing to set up a local development environment. It uses Gitpod and ddev.

> ℹ
> This is intended for you to try out LocalGov Drupal, not for running live websites.

## Before you start
1. [Sign up for gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/login), if you haven't already.

## Try it out:
1. Click on the "Gitpod ready to code" button below

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/keelanfh/localgov_project_gitpod)

1. Your environment is being prepared, wait about a minute.
1. VSCode code editor will be displayed.
1. You'll get a link to your LocalGov Drupal site in a message like this:
```
Project can be reached at https://8080-essexcounty-localgovpro-i5qq2u8hn9l.ws-eu81.gitpod.io
```
   Ctrl-click the long link to open the LocalGov Drupal website in a new tab
1. Log in with the credentials `admin` and `admin`.
> ⚠
> If you later make the site public, make sure you change the username and password - otherwise anyone with the link could control your site. By default, the project is not made public, so this is not an issue.

## Adding demo content
The LocalGov Drupal demo content showcases a lot of the content types in LocalGov Drupal. Enabling this will make your website look like https://demo.localgovdrupal.org. To do this:

1. Log in to your new LocalGov Drupal website
2. Navigate to Configure
3. Tick "LocalGov Demo" (you can enter a few letters in the search box to filter and find it
4. Scroll down and click "Install". This will install a lot of the LocalGov Drupal modules as well as some demo content.
